A python package to calculate cosmological distances in a FRW metric.

Description
-----------

A package to calculate cosmological distances.  The workhorse is a class Cosmo
that wraps and the underlying C code.  The geometry can be non-flat.

In order to take advantage of the speed of the underlying C code, you should,
if at all possible, send numpy arrays to the methods rather than repeatedly
call the python methods.

Installation
------------

        python setup.py install --prefix=/some/path

If you want to use UPS to manage your code install with the with_ups command

        python setup.py with_ups install --prefix=/some/path


Class
-----

import esutil
c=esutil.cosmology.Cosmo()

Methods
-------
DH: Return the hubble distance.
Dc: Comoving distance.
Dm: Transverse comoving distance.
Da: Angular diameter distance.
Dl: Luminosity distance.
dV: Volume element.
V:  Volume between two redshifts.
distmod: Distance modulus.
sigmacritinv: Inverse critical density for lensing.

Ez_inverse: Calculate 1/E(z)
Ezinv_integral: Calculate the integral of 1/E(z) from zmin to zmax

flat(): return if universe is flat
omega_m(): value of omega matter
omega_l(): value of omega lambda
omega_k(): value of omega curvature



Examples
--------

    import cosmology
    c=cosmology.Cosmo()

    # comoving distance to z=0.5
    c.Dc(0.0, 0.5) 

    # angular diameter distance between z=0.5 and z=0.9
    c.Da(0.5, 0.9)

    # luminosity distance between z=0.2 and a sequence of redshifts
    c.Dl(0.2, [0.3, 0.4, 0.5])

    # new cosmology
    c=cosmology.Cosmo(H0=70.0, omega_m=0.25)

    # inverse critical density for lensing, lens at 0.2 and
    # source at 0.3
    c.sigmacritinv(0.2, 0.3)


Unit Tests
----------

        import cosmology
        cosmology.test()

TODO
----
 - Add equation of state
 - Add *evolving* equation of state.
